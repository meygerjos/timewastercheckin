# Time waster check in - README

This is a simple userscript that tries to help you avoid wasting time on websites that probably aren't the best use of your time. It's not a blocker, it is simply a small, invisible timer that will try to remind you that there are probably better uses of your time than repetetively reloading your Facebook newsfeed.

It also replaces parts of the user interface on those sites that are designed to hijack your attention and waste your time by calling this out:

If you have suggestions for what other elements to modify, please open a [new issue](https://github.com/meitar/timewastercheckin/issues/new) or send a pull request with a modification to the JSON file used to make the change. (Here's the [file used for changing Facebook](https://github.com/meitar/timewastercheckin/blob/master/selectors-www.facebook.com.json).)

# How to install:

1. If you haven't already, download a userscript manager such as [TamperMonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) or [GreaseMonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) (only for Firefox).  These are browser extensions that allow you to run userscripts such as this one.
2. Go [here](https://github.com/meygerjos/timewastercheckin/raw/master/timewastercheckin.user.js) and click on "Install".

# To do:
