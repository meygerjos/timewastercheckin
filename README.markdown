# Time waster check in - README

This is a simple userscript that tries to help you avoid wasting time on websites that probably aren't the best use of your time. It's not a blocker, it is simply a small, invisible timer that will try to remind you that there are probably better uses of your time than repetetively reloading your Facebook newsfeed.

# To do:

* Add a feature that allows customization of which sites are "time wasters."
